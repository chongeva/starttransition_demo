# React.startTransition Demo

### What is it about?

Just a simple React app to test how `startTransition` works and comparing it to without `startTransition` and with `setTimeout`.
On app init, dummy results will be generated based on the `dummyResultsCount`.
When searching in the input fields, it will filter the results based on what you input, and show the filtered results below.

### How to start

Run `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
